			<span class='opensans-font'> You turn right and run towards the light. Confusion sparks across your face then pain rushes through your body as you hear a high pitch sound like a trigger going off. The sledgehammer slides out of your grip as you fall to your knees. You feel stinging against your thigh, you look down at your leg and see an empty syringe. You rip it out of your thigh as you fall to your back. You look up at the sky as the trees begin to blur and move in ways only drugs cause. Leaves crunching under shoes reverberate in your ears and get louder as the killer walks up to you. </span>

Pain rushes through you as your heart pounds in your chest as if it could explode. Tears stream down your cheeks. </span> </p>

			<p class='text-white'> <span class='lobster-font'> Death is a strange feeling. You feel a mixture of pain, numbness and regret. People say your life flashes before you die. That did not happen for you, you doubted your beliefs. One question rang in your ears several times before you died... </span></p>
			<p class='text-red'> <span class='bold'> WHAT IF I DESERVED THIS? </span></p>
