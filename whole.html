		<p class='text-white'><span class='opensans-font'> You bang on the steel door as tears blur your vison, staining your pale cheeks. You fall to your knees as you cry out feeling defeated. Footsteps reverberate on the wood floor of the cabin growing closer. You get up holding the sledgehammar tightly and turn to see your captor and soon to be killer.</span></p>

		<p class='text-white'><span class='opensans-font'>You stare deep into the killer's gold eyes and seek revenge for what he put you through. You notice he holds a steel baseball bat in one hand and a silenced pistol in the other. You charge him gripping the hammer so tight your knuckles turn white. You manage to swing the sledgehammer, with all your strength, into his side hearing a loud snap. Several of his ribs break possibily causing him internal bleeding. He stumbles but manages to grab you by the arm and throws you to the floor. </span>

		<p class='text-white'><span class='opensans-font'> As you slide across the floor, the man follows you and begins to beat you with the steel bat. With perfect timing you kick in is right knee with the sledgehammer. As he falls, you straddle him in order to choke the life out of him. </span>

He coughs as air once again enters his lungs, you grap the pistol as your shirt gets soaked in blood. Without a second to spare you shoot the killer in the chest, where his heart is located, twice. He falls to the ground as blood pools on the floor and covers his clothes. You relax for once.</span>

		<p class='text-white'><span class='lobster-font'> You smile as you look your killer in his golden eyes and speak.</span></p> 
		<p class='text-lightgreen'><span class='italic'> "You should never have chosen me as your victim. You got what your victims wished you recieved from the beginning. Now we... I can die happy.</span></p>

		<p class='text-white'> <span class='lobster-font'> It took many hours for you to die, though you were happy with your outcome. Yes, you were sad but not for him, for his past victoms, for yourself. This event was the cause of many things. Valuble things, things that can... </span></p>
