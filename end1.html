"Enough, is enough!" you yell as you stand ready to fight. The man smirks as he rushes at you. You manage to swing the hammer at his knee and hear a loud snap. The man's leg is broken and you see the bone appear through his jeans as he falls to the ground. However, he gets up with clenched fists. You hold the sledgehammer tightly as it is saving your life. The killer swings another punch. You jump back and grip the sledgehammer with white knuckles. With all the strength you have left, you hit the man in the jaw with the hammer. He falls to his knees as blood pools in his mouth. </span>
